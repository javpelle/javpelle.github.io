	<p>I am a mathematician and a computer engineer graduated from the <a href="https://ucm.es">Universidad Complutense de Madrid</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I have interests in many areas of computing such as data science, algorithmic or quantum computing. I have recently researched the application of classical testing techniques in quantum computing with my colleague <b>Luis Aguirre</b>. Specifically, we have applied <b>mutation testing</b> on quantum computing languages <a href="https://qiskit.org/documentation/#">Qiskit</a> and <a href="https://qsharp.community/">Q#</a> (<a href="https://github.com/javpelle/MTQC">Take a look at my muation testing on quantum computing project</a>).</p>
